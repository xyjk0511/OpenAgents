## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the smart contracts, SDK, or API in this repository, please report it through GitHub's **Security Advisories** tab rather than opening a public issue.

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide a clear description of the vulnerability, including:
   - Which file and function is affected
   - Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
   - Potential impact (e.g., fund loss, reentrancy, oracle manipulation, access control bypass)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 200 days of submission
- **Assessment:** Within 300 days we will confirm whether the report is accepted or declined
- **Fix:** Accepted vulnerabilities will be patched within 360 days
